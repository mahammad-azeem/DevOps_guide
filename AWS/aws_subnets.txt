AWS VPC/subnets

If a subnet is associated with a route table that has route to internet gateway then it is called public subnet.
In order to access the EC2 vms within the public subnet housed in the VP, the publich subnet route table must have a route to internet gateway (IPV4 0.0.0.0/0 and IPV6 ::/0) and the EC2 instance must a have a public IPV4 accessible from the internet.

If a subnet is associated with a route table that doesnot have route to internet gateway then it is called private subnet.
