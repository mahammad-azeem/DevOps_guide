Route Table:
These define how the network traffic to be controlled within VPC.
By default, all subnets within the VPC will have a default route table associated which enables the communication between 
different subnets within the VPC by default. In order to enforce control on traffic between subnets within the same VPC you need 
security groups and Network Access Control Lists.

Security Group:
These define the traffic that can be reached to and from the AWS resources like EC2, DynamoDB etc
They acts as firewall to prevent the traffic reaching to and from the AWS resources.

Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):
These defines to act as firewall at subnet level. Meaning, just like you how Security Groups acts as firewall at the AWS resource 
level to prevent traffic reaching to and from the AWS resources(like EC2, DynamoDB etc), the NACLs acts as firewall to allow/deny
traffic at subnet level
