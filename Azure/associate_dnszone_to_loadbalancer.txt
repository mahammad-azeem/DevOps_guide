Step 1. Your Load Balancer must have a Public Ip address assigned. If not then Login go to Azure portal and create a public ip address and associate it to the load balancer.

Step 2. Get or Register your domain from any of the online providers like go daddy, etc
Example:  devopsazure.com

Step 3. Go to Azure portal > DNS Zone > Create new zone and add the dns name "devopsazure.com". Once added this will give a list of Name servers.

Step 4. Go to your domain provider in Step 1. and navigate to > DNS > Name servers.
Add all the Name servers from Step 2 here.

Step 5. Go to Azure portal > Public Ip address > configuration (left hand pane) > Create alias record > choose the "DNS Zone" name created in Step 3.

Step 6. Enter the devopsazure.com url in the browser. It should load your webpage from the configured web servers added in the backend pool of your load balancer.
