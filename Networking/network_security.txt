Networking:

Forward proxy and Reverse Proxy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NB0NDtOwIQ

Forward Proxy:
1. It sits between the client and the Internet
2. Prevents from client's ip being exposed to internet
3. Acts as firewall by blocking malicious websites

Reverse proxy:
1. Sits between the Internet and the web servers (serving the content)
2. Prevents exposing the IP address of web servers
3. SSL encryption can be handled only for the reverse proxy and no need to handle ssl encryption at the multiple web servers
4. Acts a load balancer to distribute traffic.


SSL Certificate:

Root certificate
	Intermediate certificate
				Server certificate

All the above 3 certificates must be imported into java truststore/keystore in order to verify the website as ssl enabled

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzbf9ldvBjM&t=584s

Step 1. Generate a key file using openssl utility
>> openssl genrsa -out keyfile_name.key 2048

Step 2. Use this key to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
>> openssl req -new -key keyfile_name.key -out keyfile_name.csr

(Verify above .csr using command: openssl req -text -in keyfile_name.csr -noout -verify)

Step 3. Use the above CSR to generate a Self signed ssl certificate(.crt)
>> openssl x509 -in keyfile_name.csr -out keyfile_name.crt -key keyfile_name.key -req -days 365
