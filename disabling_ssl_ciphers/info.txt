DISABLING CIPHERS IN AN APPLICATION SERVER:

1. Find the java.security file from the Java installation path of the application server (If the application has built-in java change in    that path) having the ciphers vulnerability
2. take back up of the java.security file
3. Open java.security and edit the value jdk.tls.disabledAlgorthims=RSA, DSA, ECDH-RSA-AES128-SHA, \
																	ECDH-RSA-AES256-SHA
																	
	(you need to enter the name of the cipher)
4. Verify if the cipher is disabled by running the below command
	openssl s_client -connect ip:port -cipher <name of the cipher>
	for example:
	openssl s_client -connect ip:port -cipher ECDH-RSA-AES128-SHA
